/*
This function calls the /pods Kubelet endpoint skipping Kubelet server certificate validation for TLS
while passing a service account token for authN and authZ.

- Kubelet host: by default the client connects to localhost, which works when kubelet binds to 0.0.0.0. On clusters
where kubelet binds to the node's primary IP, set the KUBELET_HOST environment variable to the node's IP. The Helm
chart injects this via the Kubernetes Downward API (status.hostIP).

- Insecure TLS justification: by default, Kubelet serving certificates are signed by the same certificate authority as
the kube-apiserver. As a result, the CA mounted in the pod file system at file path
/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt can be used against either server. However, this server certificate
only has a valid SAN for the node's primary IP and not localhost. We skip certificate validation to handle both cases.
The metadata-collector already runs with HostNetwork=true.

- Kubelet AuthN + AuthZ: Kubelet's can optionally enabled authentication with a bearer token that is validated via a
TokenReview and authorization that is validated via a SubjectAccessReview. To ensure that our metadata-collector pod
can successfully pass AuthN + AuthZ, we will pass the pod's SA token mounted in the pod at
/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token. The service account for this component is bound to a cluster role
which grants GET permission against the nodes/proxy resource (in addition to the patch pod permissions required).

In summary, we require:
- metadata-collector pods run with GET permission on nodes/proxy
- metadata-collector pods run with HostNetwork=true and skip Kubelet server certificate validation on localhost

Example for how to make an equivalent request via CLI:
curl -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost:10250/pods
